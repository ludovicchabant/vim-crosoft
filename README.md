# Vim-crosoft

Vimcrosoft is a Vim plugin for working with Microsoft Visual Studio solutions.
It makes it possible to build solutions and projects from Vim, and integrates
with various other plugins, such as letting you list solution files in FZF, or
get code completion with YouCompleteMe.

It's currently a work in progress in alpha state.
